Hello! My name is Pol Massana and I am a professional astronomer. I specialise in galactic archaeology of the Milky Way halo. My thesis in particular was centred in the study of the Magellanic Clouds (which you can see in the image below!).

I was born in a town near Barcelona, in Catalonia. I lived all my life there whilst studying at the University of Barcelona a Physics Bachelor, which I finished in 2016. Later I did a one year Masters in Astrophysics and Cosmology at the same university, before starting my PhD in October 2017 at the University of Surrey, UK. I lived in Guildford for 3 years (with a short stay in Tenerife as well!) and then I moved to La Palma for the final year of my thesis. There, I was a part time support astronomer for the Isaac Newton Telescope (which you can see in the picture next to me). Now I live in beautiful Bozeman, Montana, for my first postdoc experience!

If you would like to know more about me and my projects, keep exloring my website. And if you are here because you are considering hiring me, check my [CV](https://pmassana.github.io/CV.pdf) as well.
