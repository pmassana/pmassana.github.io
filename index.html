<p>Hello! My name is Pol Massana and I am a professional astronomer. I specialise in galactic archaeology of the Milky Way halo. My thesis in particular was centred in the study of the Magellanic Clouds (which you can see in the image below!).</p>

<p>I was born in a town near Barcelona, in Catalonia. I lived all my life there whilst studying at the University of Barcelona a Physics Bachelor, which I finished in 2016. Later I did a one year Masters in Astrophysics and Cosmology at the same university, before starting my PhD in October 2017 at the University of Surrey, UK. I lived in Guildford for 3 years (with a short stay in Tenerife as well!) and then I moved to La Palma for the final year of my thesis. There, I was a part time support astronomer for the Isaac Newton Telescope (which you can see in the picture next to me). Now I live in beautiful Bozeman, Montana, for my first postdoc experience!</p>

<p>If you would like to know more about me and my projects, keep exloring my website. And if you are here because you are considering hiring me, check my <a href="https://pmassana.github.io/CV.pdf">CV</a> as well.</p>
